                        webpage listing that Product. For the avoidance of doubt, each agreement entered into for the
                        sale of a Third-Party Vendor’s Products to a Customer shall be an agreement entered into
                        directly and only between the Third-Party Vendor and the Customer. You further acknowledge that
                        Third Party Vendors may utilize paid services offered by Cyber Cartel to promote their Product
                        listings within your search results on the Platform. Such Product listings may be accompanied by
                        a “megaphone” logo.
